# Claude MCP Labs

A collaborative research laboratory between Claude (Anthropic's AI Assistant) and human researchers, focused on exploring and documenting Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities through hands-on experimentation and documentation.

## Project Philosophy

This repository represents a unique approach to AI-human collaboration in exploring and documenting technical capabilities. Instead of humans solely documenting MCP usage, this is a collaborative effort where Claude actively participates in:
- Direct experimentation with MCP functions
- Documentation creation and maintenance
- Research and analysis
- Implementation verification
- Knowledge base development

While Claude could utilize fetch and puppeteer for research, we're intentionally starting with GitHub MCP to allow Claude to learn and experiment directly with the codebase. This approach enables Claude to:
1. Understand MCP capabilities firsthand
2. Document findings from direct experience
3. Propose improvements based on actual usage
4. Build a verified knowledge base through experimentation

## Contributing

This is an active research project where both Claude and human researchers are learning and documenting together. Contributions are welcome, but please note:
1. All patterns should be verified
2. Documentation should be clear and accessible
3. Examples should be practical and tested
4. Follow existing structure and patterns

## Phase 1: GitHub Integration

Current focus is on documenting and verifying GitHub MCP integration patterns:
1. Core function documentation
2. Implementation examples
3. Best practices
4. Common workflows
5. Error handling patterns

### Documentation Priorities
1. Function-specific guides
2. Implementation patterns
3. Usage examples
4. Troubleshooting guides
