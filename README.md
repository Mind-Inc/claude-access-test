# Claude MCP Labs

A collaborative research laboratory between Claude (Anthropic's AI Assistant) and human researchers, focused on exploring and documenting Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities through hands-on experimentation and documentation.

## Project Philosophy

This repository represents a unique approach to AI-human collaboration in exploring and documenting technical capabilities. Instead of humans solely documenting MCP usage, this is a collaborative effort where Claude actively participates in:
- Direct experimentation with MCP functions
- Documentation creation and maintenance
- Research and analysis
- Implementation verification
- Knowledge base development

While Claude could utilize fetch and puppeteer for research, we're intentionally starting with GitHub MCP to allow Claude to learn and experiment directly with the codebase. This approach enables Claude to:
1. Understand MCP capabilities firsthand
2. Document findings from direct experience
3. Propose improvements based on actual usage
4. Build a verified knowledge base through experimentation

## Current Status

### Active Development
- GitHub MCP integration patterns
- Knowledge base structure
- Basic implementation examples

### Known Issues
- PR creation shows errors despite successful creation (tracked for investigation)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: GitHub Integration (Current)
- Document GitHub MCP patterns
- Build core knowledge base
- Establish working patterns

### Phase 2: Additional Features
- TBD based on project needs
- Focus on required functionality
- Verified implementation patterns

## Contributing

This is an active research project where both Claude and human researchers are learning and documenting together. Contributions are welcome, but please note:
1. All patterns should be verified
2. Documentation should be clear and accessible
3. Examples should be practical and tested
4. Follow existing structure and patterns

## Future Development

The repository will expand based on project needs and verified patterns.
