# MCP Inspector Access Patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Direct File Access
1. Successfully accessed branch content using get_file_contents
2. Branch specification required: feature/test-clarifications-endpoint
3. File content accessible with proper path and branch

### MCP Inspector Debug Endpoints
1. Navigator: http://localhost:5173
2. Testing endpoints:
   - Memory Graph State
   - File System Access
   - GitHub Integration

### Key Findings
1. File content directly accessible through GitHub API
2. Branch content accessible with explicit branch name
3. Testing Inspector debug capabilities

### Next Steps
1. Test Inspector's memory graph integration
2. Validate PR content access through Inspector
3. Document successful patterns

## Working Pattern
- Use branch-specific file access
- Leverage Inspector's debug capabilities
- Document access patterns for future reference
