# Error Response Behavior

## PR Creation
Despite successful PR creation, the API may return error responses:
- `merge_commit_sha error`: Operation actually succeeds
- `Unprocessable Entity`: May still result in successful PR

## Best Practices
1. Verify repository state after operations regardless of error response
2. Don't rely solely on API response for operation success
3. Implement result verification steps in workflows

## Known Patterns
- PR creation errors don't always indicate failure
- Operation success should be verified through repository state
- Error responses may need additional context for debugging
