## Verified Patterns

### Core Operations
âœ“ Repository Access
- search_repositories
- get_file_contents
- create_branch
- push_files
- create_issue
- create_pull_request

### PR Investigation
- File content access
- Branch management
- PR creation and updates

## Implementation Notes

1. **Private Repositories**
   - Branch specification required
   - Case-sensitive organization names
   - Proper error handling needed

2. **PR Operations**
   - Verify repository state after operations
   - Handle base64 encoded content
   - Implement proper error recovery

## Testing Guidelines

1. Use feature branches for testing
2. Document all successful patterns
3. Verify operations across repositories
4. Clean up test artifacts

## Current Status

- Last Updated: December 2024
- Actively maintained and verified
- Regular pattern verification
