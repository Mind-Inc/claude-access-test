# GitHub API Integration Test Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings from our GitHub API integration testing using fine-grained tokens.

## Test Results

### Working Operations
- Repository search
- Branch creation
- File operations (push_files)
- File reading (with branch specification)
- Issue creation
- PR creation (works despite error messages)
- Issue closure via PR merge

### Operation Patterns
1. **Branch Operations**
   - Create feature branch first
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., feature/*, test/*)

2. **File Operations**
   - Use push_files for multiple files
   - Always specify branch when reading files
   - Maintain organized directory structure

3. **Issue Management**
   - Create tracking issues for tests
   - Use markdown formatting
   - Close via PR using 'Closes #X' syntax

4. **PR Creation**
   - Create branch → Add files → Create PR
   - Link to issues using 'Closes #X'
   - Ignore merge_commit_sha error (PR still creates)

## Key Findings
1. Fine-grained token works consistently across public/private repos
2. Some operations work despite returning error messages
3. Branch specification improves reliability
4. Automated issue closure works via PR merges
